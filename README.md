## Setup the project
### 0. Install Python
This project uses **[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31110/)**. You can try a older verion of Python, but you may have compatibility issues.

### 1. Create a virtual environment 

By default Python will install a projects dependencies (requirements) globally. This may cause compatibility issues if you have multiple Python projects on your PC. In order to avoid this, you will need to use a virutal environmet that will store a projects dependencies separately.
```
# Install the virtualenv library globally
python -m pip install venv

# Create a virtual environment inside the current folder
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

Depending on your operating system, you will need to run a speciffic command to step into the virtual environment.
```
# On Windows
./.venv/Scripts/activate

# On Linux and MacOS
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```
You'll know the command worked if the command line you'll see `(.venv)` at the beggining of the line.

### 3. Install dependencies

The project has several dependencies that were stored inside the `requirements.txt` file which are needed to run the code.

```
# Install the dependencies inside the virutal environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

You'll need to download the environment files that correspond to your Operating System [from here](https://github.com/2BytesGoat/ENV-DragonJump/actions/runs/11308886001). Those files could be placed inside the `./environments` after unpacking them.

To check that everything works as expected run the following command, after you **activated your virtual environment**.

```
# Start random agent
python 00_random_agent.py --env_path ./environments/DragonJump/ENV-DragonJump
```

The game will automatically stop after the Agent has done 1000 steps. In case you want to continue after the Agent is done, checkout the code and reset the environment.

## What's to come:

- [x] ~~find a place to store the environment files at~~
- [ ] add a link to download the env files from
- [ ] update godot library to support input configurations
- [ ] commit library changes to git

## The GOATs

This repo is basically a amalgamation of information I gathered from multiple smart and passionate people. Without them making their work publicly available for free, this repo wouldn't exist.

* **[GodotRL](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents)** - I would never have started working on this repo if it weren't for **Ed Beeching** and his wonderful Godot library for training Machine Learning agents.
* **[Heartbeast](https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast)** - I probably wound not know Godot if it weren't for **Benjamin** and his Godot tutorials. He is a awesome teacher that lit the fire inside my hearth, both for learning Godot and teaching others.
* **[Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex)** - The first ever video I watched about computer vision and machine learning was from **Harrison Kinsley**. On my first internship I used his tutorials to learn about Haar Cascades and Image classification. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be a Machine Learning engineer today.

And for this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
