  - wait_until:
      condition: is_object_near
      args: [WALL, RIGHT, 0.5]
  - action: jump

**Here's an example of how you can combine multiple checks:**
plan:
  - action: do_nothing
  - wait_until:
      operator: OR
      conditions:
        - operator: OR
          conditions:
            - condition: is_object_near
              args: [WALL, RIGHT, 0.5]
            - condition: is_object_far
              args: [WALL, UP, 0.2]
        - condition: is_sliding_on_wall
  - action: jump

**Output:**
A single string representing the checks and action. Do not add any other checks that were not mentioned in the critic's feedback.
Answer only with the plan as a YAML object and nothing else. Do not use any markdown formatting, code blocks, or backticks (```). Return only the raw YAML content without any wrapper formatting.
