Human: 
Your role is to plan the next series of actions and checks for an agent navigating a 2D environment. Analyze the following status_report and plan - and decide what next check or action should the agent perform. 


The character can perform the following checks:
- is_object_near(object_type: str [see objects above], direction: str [see directions above], distance: float [0.0 - 1.0]) -> bool - checks if there is any object closer than the threshold
- is_object_far(object_type: str [see objects above], direction: str [see directions above], distance: float [0.0 - 1.0]) -> bool - checks if there is any object further than the threshold
- changed_direction() -> bool - checks if the character changed direction

The character can perform the following actions:
- release_jump() -> None - releases the jump. need to release the jump button to fall. need to release the jump button to jump again.
- jump() -> None - jumps. holding jump will make the character jump higher. holding the jump too long will make the character fall.

The objects are:
- NOTHING
- WALL

The directions are:
- UP
- UP-RIGHT
- RIGHT
- DOWN-RIGHT
- DOWN
- DOWN-LEFT
- LEFT
- UP-LEFT


your answer should be 2 bullet points:
* what the agent should check for 
* what action the agent should take once the check is satisfied 

Here are the status reports from the agent:
Step 1:
- **Closeness to Goal:**
  - The goal is located in the UP-RIGHT direction.
  - The agent is moving DOWN-RIGHT, which is away from the goal.
  
- **Obstacle Awareness:**  
  - The agent is close to several walls: 
    - DOWN-RIGHT (0.71), DOWN (0.79), DOWN-LEFT (0.71), and LEFT (0.74).
  - These walls flank the direction towards the goal (UP-RIGHT).

- **Jump Conditions:**  
  - The agent is in the air and cannot jump again.
  - There are no overhead or mid-range obstacles reported that would influence jump feasibility.

- **Sensor Openings:**  
  - There are clear paths (object_type: NOTHING) in the UP and UP-RIGHT directions. 
  - The agent has no clear paths in the DOWN, DOWN-RIGHT, DOWN-LEFT, LEFT, or UP-LEFT directions.

**Important:**
You need to release the jump button to fall. You need to release the jump button to jump again.
You can hold the jump button to make the character jump higher. Holding the jump too long will make the character fall.
You must satisfy the check before the action is performed. You cannot perform another check until the previous checks are satisfied.
There can be multiple compound checks but only one action.

Here is the current plan:
plan:
- action: do_nothing
- wait_until:
    args:
    - WALL
    - UP-RIGHT
    - 1.0
    condition: is_object_far
- action: jump
- wait_until:
    args:
    - WALL
    - UP-RIGHT
    - 1.0
    condition: is_object_far
- action: jump
- wait_until:
    args:
    - WALL
    - UP-RIGHT
    - 1.0
    condition: is_object_far
- action: release_jump
